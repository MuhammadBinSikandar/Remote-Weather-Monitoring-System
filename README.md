# Remote Weather Monitoring System

## Overview
The Remote Weather Monitoring System is a comprehensive application designed to fetch and display data from personal weather stations. Built on Django and utilizing numerous Python libraries, the system provides real-time weather monitoring through a user-friendly front end created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Real-time data fetching from weather stations.
- Visualization of weather parameters including temperature, humidity, and pressure.
- Responsive design to support various screen sizes.
- Historical data tracking and display.
- Machine learning models for future weather predictions.

## Project Structure
The project includes the following major components:
- **Django Backend**: Handles data fetching, storage, and processing.
- **Frontend**: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interactive data display.
- **MongoDB**: Used for storing weather data.
